    "## Overview\n",
    "In this session we will learn how to post more complex graphs to GraphSpace programatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main goals of this tutorial is to help you share and interact with your own networks online at GraphSpace (www.graphspace.org).  We suggest you bring your network(s) in a tab-delimited file of edges and have an idea of some of the visual properties (colors, edge style, node shapes) you want to use and we'll help you make it interactable and shareable online in this last session.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have an example workflow where we will be repeating the analysis done by Ritz et al. [1] to reconstruct the WNT signaling pathway using PathLinker. In their analysis, they reconstructed signaling pathways using the set receptors and transcription factors (TFs) of a pathway as sources and targets for PathLinker. I have provided the receptors and TFs of the WNT pathway as well as an updated version of the human protein-protein interaction network (background interactome) for us to repeat their reconstruction of the WNT pathway. The figure below shows an overview of their analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example workflow, you will learn how to take a list of edges create a high-quality graph sharable online.\n",
    "More specifically you'll learn to programatically:\n",
    "1. Set shapes, colors, and styles to nodes and edges based on chosen node and edge properties\n",
    "2. Add filters to your graph to focus on different pieces or sections of the graph\n",
    "3. Add important node and edge information to popups that link to additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "After posting those results to GraphSpace you should have a pretty good idea how to get your own networks onto GraphSpace.\n",
